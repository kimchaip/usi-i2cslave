# usi-i2cslave
An I2C slave driver for Atmel Microcontrollers with the USI module.

Adapted from the reference implemented provided by Atmel in AVR312. Heavy commented to make it easier to follow. Designed specifically for the attiny2313. If you want to use it for anything other than the attiny2313, you will need to modify the port definitions and interrupt vector definitions in the header file.
